============

Codes for the implementation of High Dynamic Range simultaneous signal composting applied to audio

PROJECT PURPOSE: The project is an implementation of the concept derived in reference paper (mentioned below) 
in MATLAB/Python and seeks to give a head start to the applications mentioned in the research paper 
(like biomedical pulsed ultrasound, and research on water-hammer  effects where very strong acoustic 
impulse occurs periodically, and very weak sounds need to be sensed as well).

Reference Paper Used : Ryan Janzen and Steve Mann, “HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE SIMULTANEOUS SIGNAL COMPOSITING,
 APPLIED TO AUDIO”2012 25th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE).
